<h1 class='page-header'>About Us</h1>

    <p>  The Laboratory for Cosmological Data Mining was founded in 2002 at the University of Illinois by Professor Robert J. Brunner to develop and apply computational technologies to extract cosmological information from the large astrophysical data sets being generated within our community. LCDM has been one of the top twenty users worldwide of the production supercomputing resources at the National Center for supercomputing Applications.</p>

    <p> Since then, we have grown to include 5 graduate students and roughly 20 undergraduate students (see <a href='/people'>People</a>) from a variety of disciplines. These students work on a diverse set of <a href="/projects">projects</a> including but not limited to: 
    <ul>
    	<li>Cosmology</li>
    	<li>Internet of Things</li>
    	<li>Text Analytics</li> 
    	<li>Business Analytics</li> 
    </ul>
    See the <a href="/code">Research</a> page for more information as well as links to papers and code.
