          <span class="text-success">Mar 28, 2016</span>

        <p>Abstract A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. In graph database, edges and nodes can be modified flexibly. In other words, it depends less on a rigid schema and new properties can be added in without changing all the other existing data. This project is trying to examine what situations graph database can be applied to and what are...</p>

          <span class="text-success">Mar 26, 2016</span>

        <p>Abstract Isolation Forest is a new machine learning algorithm similar in structure to Random Forest, but with a different, yet straightforward method. Instead of clustering normal instances in the data set, Isolation Forest primarily concerns itselfs with predicting the outliers by finding the data that branches out the quickest from the decision trees. This project intends to explore this algorithm further to find any interesting properties that could make predicting simpler, quicker, or more accurate....</p>

        <p>Abstract

This project aims to improve existing news article geocoding techniques in collaboration with the Cline Center for Democracy. We also intend to explore the challenges imposed by event-level instead of article-level geocoding and survey existing technologies and implementations.

        <p>Abstract Hello, World! This is the first example project post! In this section you may wish to include the “abstract” of your project, which is a short description that covers the motivation, proposed methods, and perhaps initial findings. People This section should be similar to the would-be authors of whatever paper you might write. Example: Professor Robert J.
