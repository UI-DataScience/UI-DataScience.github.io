    <p>Hello, World! This is the first post from the UI-Data Science Blog/News feed. All the members of our group will be able to create markdown files to share their ideas and accomplishments with the outside world. This blog is run with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the site is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The past few weeks have been very humbling as I’ve tried to get this site and blog off the ground. Finally this hacking endeavor has resulted in this semi-functional tool that I hope our group will use for years to come. Lets take a quick tour of Jekyll’s (and markdown’s) features.</p>

<h4 id="markdown-styling">Markdown Styling</h4>

<p>I could go through the rigmarole of demonstrating markdown syntax, but <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">this cheatsheet</a> has already done that for you. Check it out, it’s pretty thorough.</p>

<h4 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</h4>

<p>Those familiar with markdown already know of the backticks for code formatting, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">code</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">directory</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mv /bin /dev/null</code> (NEVER execute that in a linux terminal by the way, although it shouldn’t let you anyway). But Jekyll has special syntax highlighting dependent on the language (this is Python):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
	<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
		<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Hello World'</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’m certainly not a markdown expert, but you get the picture.</p>

<h4 id="creating-new-posts">Creating New Posts</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">Jekyll Docs</a> do a pretty concise job of explaining how to create posts, and it involves creating a markdown file in a certain directory (<code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code>) following a certain convention. I can picture more than one automated and more user-friendly way of doing that, so that may be an interesting direction to move in the future.</p>

<h4 id="things-to-note">Things to Note</h4>

<p>Currently only the most recent post will be shown on the front page. The full blog is available through our <a href="http://ui-datascience.github.io/blog">blog page</a>.</p>
