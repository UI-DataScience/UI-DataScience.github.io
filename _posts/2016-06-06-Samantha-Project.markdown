## Abstract
This project focuses on extracting images of galaxies from SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) data sets, and then applying deep learning codes on said images and their associated redshifts so as to create a trained neural network.  Once this neural network is trained, it will be able to identify a galaxy’s redshift given only its SDSS image.  This work aims to improve on the previous work done by Ben Hoyle (see reference paper).
