## Abstract

This project aims to improve existing news article geocoding techniques in collaboration with the [Cline Center for Democracy](http://www.clinecenter.illinois.edu/). We also intend to explore the challenges imposed by event-level instead of article-level geocoding and survey existing technologies and implementations.
