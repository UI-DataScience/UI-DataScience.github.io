summary: "We have released our SDSS DR7 two-point galaxy angular correlation function measurements and corresponding covariance matrices."
---

## Introduction

We are publicly releasing both the angular correltaion function
estimates (computed with the Landy & Szalay estimor) and the associated
covariance matrices for the SDSS DR7 galaxy sample first presented in [Wang, Brunner, & Dolence
2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1303.2432).

## Data

### Angular Correlation Functions

This first column of these files is the angle in degrees, the second
column is the estimator, and the third column is the error of the
estimator.

### Covariance Matrices:

This first row and the first column of these files are the angles in
degrees, others are the values of the corresponding covariances.
