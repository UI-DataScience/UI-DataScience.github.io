## Abstract

Hello, World! This is the first example project post! In this section you may wish to include the "abstract" of your project, which is a short description that covers the motivation, proposed methods, and perhaps initial findings. 

## People

This section should be similar to the would-be authors of whatever paper you might write. Example:

* Professor Robert J. Brunner, Department of Astronomy 
* Andrew Mehrmann, Department of Statistics
* Another Student, Department of Underwater Basket Weaving

## References

This section should include the papers or software your project is based on. It also may be a good place to keep track of this kind of thing. 

## Code

You might want to link to your github repository or specific project folder. It would be a good idea to have a README.md in there to welcome curious visitors. 

## Notes on Creating a Post

You have to follow the naming convention of this post `<date><your-title>.markdown`. This file must be in the `_posts` directory. You also have to make sure the header is formatted correctly:

1. `layout`: don't change this, it should read **post**
2. `title`: Title of your project
3. `date`: follow the convention, and be very exact. Also make sure the date/time isn't in the future (remember DST!)
4. `categories`: must read *project*. This is how Jekyll knows where to put which posts.
