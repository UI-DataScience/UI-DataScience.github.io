## Abstract
This research project is focused on applying astronomical images to estimate the photometric redshifts of stellar objects at the pixel level. The idea of photometric redshift estimation based on images has been tested by various machine learning algorithms (Carrasco & Brunner, 2014a; Zitlau et al., 2016), yet previous research programs take the overall fluxes of objects instead of the flux data at all pixels in the FITS image. By switching to pixels for training, we multiple the amount of available data in a given area, and hence, we expect an increase in prediction accuracy. In addition, pixel-level machine learning on astronomical images may solve the problem that overlapped galaxies/stars could have different redshift values, because we raise the resolution of data.
