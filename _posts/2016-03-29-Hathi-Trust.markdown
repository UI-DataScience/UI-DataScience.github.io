## Abstract

HathiTrust is a partnership where research institutions and libraries work together to ensure that
records and files are preserved and accessible long into the future. The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC)
and the HathiTrust Digital Library help meet the challenges of managing massive amounts of digital information
researchers face by developing software tools to enable advanced computational access to the growing records
of human knowledge. HTRC provides a secure computational and data environment for students to perform research
using the HathiTrust Digital Library, and the center also allows scholars to fully utilize the content in the
HathiTrust Library while preventing intellectual property misuse within the limits of U.S. copyright law.

The focus of this project is to gain a better understanding of how HathiTrust works, and to examine the significance
of information provided in Hathi's extracted features.
