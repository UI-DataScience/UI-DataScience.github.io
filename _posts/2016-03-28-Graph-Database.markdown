## Abstract

A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. In graph database, edges and nodes can be modified flexibly. In other words, it depends less on a rigid schema and new properties can be added in without changing all the other existing data. This project is trying to examine what situations graph database can be applied to and what are the limitations of graph database.
