## Abstract

This project uses data from the Irish Social Science Data Archive(ISSDA), specifically data from the Commision for Energy Regulation(CER). CER is the regulator for the electricity and natural gas sectors in Ireland. Its aim is to create a single European electricity market that best meets the needs of Europe’s energy consumers. The CER Smart Metering Project was initiated in 2007 with the purpose of undertaking trials to assess the performance of Smart Meters, their impact on consumers’ energy consumption and the economic case for a wider national rollout. The data is currently being analyzed for clusters and a specific matter for research is being developed.
