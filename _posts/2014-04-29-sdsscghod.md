### Abstract:

We analyze the clustering of photometrically selected galaxy pairs by
using the halo-occupation distribution (HOD) model. We select galaxy
pairs in three volume limited samples: $0.0 < z \leq 0.3$, $M_{r}\ <
-19.0$, $0.0 < z \leq 0.3$, $M_{r}\ < -19.5$, and $0.3 < z \leq 0.4$,
$M_{r}\ < -19.5$. These samples are cut from our clean galaxy sample
that we generated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Data Release
7 (DR7). We measure the two-point auto-correlation functions,
$\omega(\theta)$, for galaxies and galaxy pairs and develop an HOD to
model their clustering. Our results are successfully fit by these HOD
models, and we see the separation of "1-halo" and "2-halo" clustering
terms for both single galaxies and galaxy pairs. Our clustering
measurements and HOD model fits for the single galaxy samples are
consistent with previous results. We find that the galaxy pairs
generally have larger clustering amplitudes than single galaxies, and
the quantities computed during the HOD fitting, e.g., effective mass,
$M_{eff}$, and linear bias, $b_{g}$, are also larger for galaxy pairs.
We find that the central fractions for galaxy pairs are significantly
higher than for single galaxies, which confirms that galaxy pairs are
formed at the center of more massive dark matter haloes. We also model
the clustering dependence of the galaxy pair correlation function on
redshift, galaxy type, and luminosity. We find early-early pairs cluster
more strongly than late-late pairs, that bright galaxy pairs cluster
more strongly than dim galaxy pairs, and that the clustering does not
depend on the luminosity contrast between the two galaxies in the
compact group.
