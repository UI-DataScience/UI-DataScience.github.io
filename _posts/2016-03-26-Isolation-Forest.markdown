## Abstract

Isolation Forest is a new machine learning algorithm similar in structure to Random Forest, but with a different, yet straightforward method. Instead of clustering normal instances in the data set, Isolation Forest primarily concerns itselfs with predicting the outliers by finding the data that branches out the quickest from the decision trees. This project intends to explore this algorithm further to find any interesting properties that could make predicting simpler, quicker, or more accurate. If we find any of these properties, it could garner more interest to this method and possibly be implemented to certain real world applications.
